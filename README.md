## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Handled missing values
- Converted categorical features into numerical ones
- Standardized numerical columns
- Created dummy variables for modeling

  ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
Plotted distributions and relationships (e.g., how contract type affects churn)
Found that:
- Customers on monthly contracts churn more
- Higher monthly charges correlate with higher churn
- Shorter tenure (new customers) = more likely to churn

## Model Building
Used machine learning models to predict churn:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* XGBoost

## Evaluated each model with metrics:
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC AUC

- Best performing model likely to be XGBoost or Random Forest based on typical churn datasets.

## Real-Time Benefits

ðŸ”¹ For Telecom/Service Providers:
*Proactively prevent churn by targeting at-risk customers with:
1. Discounts
2. Better plans
3. Loyalty rewards

ðŸ”¹ Financial Benefits:
1. Reduce customer acquisition costs (which are higher than retention costs)
2. Improve lifetime value of customers

ðŸ”¹ Operational Efficiency:
1. Target marketing efforts more precisely
2. Reduce unnecessary spending on customers unlikely to churn

ðŸ”¹ Strategic Planning:
1. Understand which services lead to dissatisfaction
2. Improve those services or offer alternatives

## Results (Expected or Typical)

- Accuracy: Often around 80â€“85%
- Recall: High for churners to avoid losing customers
- Feature Importance: Contract type, tenure, internet service, and monthly charges are strong predictors
